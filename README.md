# Personal Website

Sean McKenna's personal website and portfolio

## Installation

```ShellSession
$ npm install
# grabs all resources to work offline
```

However, fonts will fallback to system defaults without an internet connection. You can download the [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) fonts for offline use, which I would recommend using [SkyFonts](https://www.fonts.com/web-fonts/google) to do so easily.

## Usage

```ShellSession
$ npm start
# sync browser and watch for changes (offline mode)

$ npm test
# build and test on a web server (offline mode)

$ npm run deploy
# build for production environment (online mode)
```

The code for my website has been rewritten from scratch to work and look better with less Javascript.

The inspiration for this website's design came from [AJ](http://n33.co)'s [Prologue template](http://html5up.net/prologue) from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/).
