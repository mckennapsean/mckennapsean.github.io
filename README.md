# Personal Website

Sean McKenna's personal website and portfolio

## Installation

```ShellSession
$ npm install
$ npm run resources
# grabs all media resources locally
```

## Usage

```ShellSession
$ npm start
# build, watch for changes, and refresh browser on change

$ npm run prod
# build for production environment (static)
```

## Caveats

Without an internet connection, some resources will not be available, like Font Awesome icons or table-sorter. Also, fonts will fallback to system defaults. You can download the [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) and [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) fonts for offline use, which I would recommend using [SkyFonts](https://www.fonts.com/web-fonts/google) to do so easily.
