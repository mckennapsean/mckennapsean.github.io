Many factors can shape the flow of visual data-driven stories, and thereby the
way readers experience those stories. Through the analysis of 80 existing
stories found on popular websites, we systematically investigate and identify
seven characteristics of these stories, which we name "flow-factors," and we
illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of "visual narrative flow."
These flow-factors are navigation input, level of control, navigation progress,
story layout, role of visualization, story progression, and navigation feedback.
We also describe a series of studies we conducted, which shed initial light on
how different visual narrative flows impact the reading experience. We report on
two exploratory studies, in which we gathered reactions and preferences of
readers for stepper- vs. scroller-driven flows. We then report on a crowdsourced
study with 240 participants, in which we explore the effect of the combination
of different flow-factors on readers’ engagement. Our results indicate that
visuals and navigation feedback (e.g., static vs. animated transitions) have an
impact on readers’ engagement, while level of control (e.g., discrete vs.
continuous) may not.
