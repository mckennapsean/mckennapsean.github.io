This is an on-going research project exploring the visualization of set-based data, looking at different possible representations and tasks. The motivating example began with a biology collaborator's dataset, where many genes had many possible groupings (or sets). We first explored developing an interactive legend to accompany another view. Since then, we have expanded our research and also begun to consider a variety of other problems, including the exploration of different sets of rhymes that occur within poems. Set visualization is challenging, and we are slowly trying to tease out why and what we can do to make set visualization more effective.
