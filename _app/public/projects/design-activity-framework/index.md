The design activity framework is a novel process model for visualization design, where overlapping design activities are composed of motivations, methods, and outcomes. Its purpose is to try and more completely capture the complex nature of design. To strengthen the framework, we provide a list of exemplar methods and how they overlap among these activities. This framework is the result of reflective discussions from a collaboration on a [visualization redesign project](../cybersecurity-redesign), so we provide the details of this project to ground the framework in a real-world design process.
