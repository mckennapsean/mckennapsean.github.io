An important aspect in visualization design is the connection between what you do and the decisions you make. However, the current design process models that the visualization community proposes and utilizes do not explicitly link back to models for visualization design decisions. We bridge this gap by introducing the design activity framework, which clearly connects back to a well-known decision model for visualization design: the nested model. We describe four overlapping activities that characterize the design process, while showing how outcomes relate to the nested model. To strengthen the framework, we further provide a list of exemplar methods and how they overlap among these activities. This framework is the result of reflective discussions from a collaboration on a [visualization redesign project](../cybersecurity-redesign), so we provide the details of this project to ground the framework in a real-world design process. Lastly, from this cybersecurity redesign project, we provide a series of problem characterization outcomes, such as an extended data hierarchy model and rich opportunities for future visualization research in this domain.
